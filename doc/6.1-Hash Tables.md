# Hash Tables

## Hash Functions

> Hash function: Method for computing array index from key.

Issue:

- Computing the hash function
- **Equality test**: Method for checking whether two keys are equal.
- **Collision resolution**: Algorithm and data structure to handle two keys that hash to the same array index.

Classic space-time tradeoff:

- No space limitation: trivial hash function with key as index.
- No time limitation: trivial collision resolution with sequential search.
- Space and time limitation: hashing (the real world).

**Computing the hash function**:

>  Idealistic goal: Scramble the keys uniformly to produce a table index.

- Efficiently computable.
- Each table index equally likely for each key.

Hash code design:

- Combine each significant field using the $31x + y$ rule.
- If field is a primitive type, sue wrapper type `hashCode()`
- If field is null, return 0.
- If field is a reference type, use `hashCode()`
- If field is an array, apply to each entry.

> In practice: Recipe works reasonably well, used in Java libraries.
>
> In theory: Keys are bitstring; "universal" hash functions exist.

## Separate Chaining

### Collisions

Collision: Two distinct keys hashing to same index.

- Birthday problem => can's avoid collisions unless you have a ridiculous (quadratic) amount of memory.
- Coupon collector + load balancing => collisions will be evenly distributed.

> Challenge: Deal with collisions efficiently.

**Separate chaining symbol table**:

Use an array of M < N linked links.

- Hash: map key to integer $i$ between $0$ and $M-1$
- Insert: put at front of $i^{th}$ chain (if not already there).
- Search: need to search only $i^{th}$ chain.

## Linear Probing

**Collision resolution: open addressing**

> Open addressing: When a new key collides, find next empty slot, ant put it there.

- Hash: Map key to integer $i$ between $0$ and $M-1$.
- Insert: Put at table index $i$ if free; if not try `i+1`, `i+2`, etc.

>Note: Array size M **must be** greater than number of key-value pairs N.
