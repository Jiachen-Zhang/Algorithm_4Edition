# Geometric Applications of BSTs

## 1D Range Search

Extension of ordered symbol table:

- Insert key-value pair
- Search for key $k$
- Delete key $k$
- **Range search**: find all keys between $k1$ and $k2$.
- **Range count**: number of keys between $k1$ and $k2â€‹$.

> Application: Database queries.

Geometric interpretation:

- Keys are point on a line.
- Find / count points in a given 1d interval.

### BST implementation

```java
public int size(Key lo, Key hi) {
  if (contains(hi)) return rank(hi) - rank(lo) + 1;
  else							return rank(hi) - rank(lo);
}
```

1D range search: Find all keys between `lo` and `hi`

- Recursively find all keys in left subtree (if any could fall in range).
- Check key in current node.
- Recursively find all keys in right subtree (if any could fall in range).

## Line Segment Intersection

### Orthogonal line segment intersection search

Sweep vertical line from left to right.

- x-coordinates define events.
- h-segment (left endpoint): insert y-coordinate into BST.
- h-segment (right endpoint): remove y-coordinate from BST.
- v-segment: range search for interval of y-endpoints.

> Sweep line reduces 2d orthogonal line segment intersection search to 1d range search.
