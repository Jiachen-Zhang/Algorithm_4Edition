# Geometric Applications of BSTs

## 1D Range Search

Extension of ordered symbol table:

- Insert key-value pair
- Search for key $k$
- Delete key $k$
- **Range search**: find all keys between $k1$ and $k2$.
- **Range count**: number of keys between $k1$ and $k2â€‹$.

> Application: Database queries.

Geometric interpretation:

- Keys are point on a line.
- Find / count points in a given 1d interval.

### BST implementation

```java
public int size(Key lo, Key hi) {
  if (contains(hi)) return rank(hi) - rank(lo) + 1;
  else							return rank(hi) - rank(lo);
}
```

1D range search: Find all keys between `lo` and `hi`

- Recursively find all keys in left subtree (if any could fall in range).
- Check key in current node.
- Recursively find all keys in right subtree (if any could fall in range).

## Line Segment Intersection

### Orthogonal line segment intersection search

Sweep vertical line from left to right.

- x-coordinates define events.
- h-segment (left endpoint): insert y-coordinate into BST.
- h-segment (right endpoint): remove y-coordinate from BST.
- v-segment: range search for interval of y-endpoints.

> Sweep line reduces 2d orthogonal line segment intersection search to 1d range search.

## Kd-Trees

Extension of ordered symbol-table to 2d keys:

- Insert a 2d key
- Delete a 2d key
- Search for a 2d key
- **Range search**: find all keys that lie in a 2d range
- **Range count**: number of keys that lie in a 2d range.

Geometric interpretation:

- Keys are point in the plane
- Find / count points in a given h-v rectangle.

> Applications: Networking, circuit design, database.

2D orthogonal range search: **grid implementation**

- Divide space into M-by-M grid of squares
- Create list of points contained in each square.
- Use 2d array to directly index relevant square.
- Insert: add `(x, y)` to list for corresponding square.
- Range search: examine only squares that intersect 2d range query.

Space partition trees:

- Grid: Divide space uniformly into squares.
- 2d Trees: Recursively divide space into two halfplanes.
- Quadtree: Recursively divide space into four quadrants.
- BSP tree: Recursively divide space into two regions.

Range search in a 2d tree:

> Find all points in a query axis-aligned rectangle.

- Check if point in node lies in given rectangle.
- Recursively search left/ bottom (if any can fall in rectangle)
- Recursively search right/ top (if any can fall in rectangle)

> Step 2&4 is In-order traversal.

### Flocking boids:

Boids: Three simple rules lead to complex emergent flocking behavior

- Collision avoidance: point away from k nearest boids.
- Flock centering: point towards the center of mass of k nearest boids.
- Velocity matching: update velocity to the average of k nearest boids.

### Kd-Tree

> Recursively partition k-dimensional space into 2 half spaces.

Implementation: BST, but cycle through dimensions ala 2d trees.

> Efficient, simple data structure for processing k-dimensional data.
>
> - Widely used
> - Adapts well to high-dimensional and clustered data.
> - Discovered by an undergrad in an algorithms class.

### N-body simulation

> Goal: Simulate the motion of N particles, mutually affected by gravity.

> Brute force: For each pair of particles, compute force: $F = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}$

Key idea: Suppose particle is far, far away from cluster of particles

- Treat cluster of particles as a single aggregate particle.
- Compute force between particle and **center of mass** of aggregate.

**Appel's algorithm for N-body simulation**

- Build 3d-tree with N particles as nodes.
- Store center-of-mass of subtree in each node.
- To compute total force acting on a particle, traverse tree, but stop as soon as distance from particle to subdivision is sufficiently large.

## Interval Search Trees

### 1d interval search API

```java
public class IntervalST<Key extends Comparable<Key>, Value>
	IntervalST()													// create interval search tree
	
  void put(Key lo, Key hi, Value val)		// put interval-value pair into ST
  
  Value get(Key lo, Key hi)							// value paired with given interval
  
  void delete(Key lo, Key hi)						// delete the given interval
  
  Iterable<Value> intersects(Key lo, Key hi)	// all intervals that intersect the given interval
```

> Nondegeneracy assumption: No two intervals have the same left endpoints

### Interval search trees

Create BST, where each node stores an interval $(lo, hi)$

- use left endpoint as BST **key**.
- Store **max endpoint** in the subtree rooted at node.

To insert an interval $(lo, hi)$

- Insert into BST, using `lo` as the key.
- Update max in each node on search path.

To search for any one interval that intersects query interval $(lo, hi)$

- If interval in node intersects query interval, return it.
- Else if left subtree is null, go right.
- Else if max endpoint in left subtree is less than `lo`, go right.
- Else go left.

```java
Node x = root;
while(x != null){
       if (x.interval.intersects(lo, hi)) return x.interval;
  else if (x.left == null) x = x.right;
  else if (x.left.max < lo) x =x.right;
  else x = x.left;
}
return null;
```

> Case 1: If search go right, then no intersection in left. 	Proof in slide page 46.
>
> Case 2: If search goes left, then there is either an intersection in left subtree or no intersection in either. Proof in slide page 47.

Use Red-Black BST to guarantee performance.

## Rectangle Intersection

Orthogonal rectangle intersection search: sweep-line algorithm

Sweep vertical line from left to right.

- x-coordinates of left and right endpoints define events.
- Maintain set of rectangles that intersect the sweep line in an interval search tree (using y-intervals of rectangle)
- Left endpoint: interval search for y-interval of rectangle; insert y-interval.
- Right endpoint: remove y-interval.

> Sweep line reduces 2d orthogonal rectangle intersection search to 1d interval search.
